# Anytype-Setup
Some usage notes, setup explanation and documentation on how to use Anytype

How did I do my setup?


1. I removed all the preloaded content, except tracker, all my objects, my notes, ideas and journal.
2. Import all my notion notes (about 200 notes) this was a relatively easy job because there are very few notes, but it took me about two days between work and other activities. Here the annoying thing is that you can't import all the notes at once, they go one by one. 
3. Once I had all my notes, I created object types depending on the topic, mine were: Mascot, Quotes, Story, Thesaurus, Cinema, Mythology, Philosophy, Notetaking, Literature, Modus Operandi, Zettel, Language, Bussines, Marginalia, Courses and Resources.
4. For relationships create different tags: Developer, Marginalia, Bussines, Courses, Modus Operandi, Literature, Philosophy, Zettel, Mythology, Notetaking, Marginalia, Language, you are in general mode. For a specific set I created English and www, but that was on the fly. This is because the relationships allow me to filter the objects and link them to collections regardless of their type, I did this thinking about the future.
5. Once these were created, the thing was to classify all the types of objects according to the theme of the note. I also created the specific Set for each type of object. The reason for this is that it is the easiest way to create links. Once you have the Set with all the notes of that theme, you convert it to collection and the linking is automatic, otherwise you would have to do it object by object.
6. Once the sets are transformed into collections, you can see the graph and see all the links of your notes. And this way you can later link various objects to a specific collection.
7. I implemented two types of structures, which so far, have worked very well for me, the first one is PARA, to have a control over my daily life and the development of personal projects. The second one is Zettelkasten, or at least a very simplified version adapted to my needs.
8. To implement PARA I made 3 collections: Projects, Areas and Resources.  For projects I made a dedicated object with the same name. In areas I linked the areas of my life, that so far I am documenting, which are my car contract, my journal and pets. In Resources I have linked ideas and my notes, plus some zettels that I use.
9. For Archive I create a set, with a relation of last modified date and in filter, the relation of Tag with "has any of" #archive. This so that when I tag an object with "archive" it is displayed directly in this set and I can find it easily.
10. For the Zettelkasten I only created a set with relation "last modified date" and from there I created views with specific filters for literature, mythology, philosophy, notetaking, etc. Thus I can visualize them in a single "database" and I can also see their connections from the graph. 
11. The missing objects, with generic type like page or document (which I found no difference, so I just kept page) that were not linked to any set or collection, I linked them manually from the graph. 
12. As it is a PKM I really only have two humans, the main one: Me. That serves both as a home page and as a place to have some topics that I like to visualize at the beginning of my day. The other one is some kind of dashboard for my main occupation at the moment which is programming. 

Some considerations to keep in mind when creating your space.


- Objects can only be linked to collections or other objects, but not to sets (this to see them in the graph or flow).
- With sets you can create an object anywhere and by choosing the type, it is automatically displayed in the set to which it corresponds.
- Sets are used to create database views that have the same type of object regardless of their relationships or attributes.
- Collections are like folders where you organize all objects regardless of type but that are of the same subject.
- With collections you don't, you have to enter the collection and there create it to take it into account, this automatically links it with the collection.
- That is a bit annoying if you are used to create notes without much categorization and then sort them. 
- I don't see any difference between a document object type and a pag object type, I'll stick with page which is the default and can't be deleted.
- One option is to make sets of objects like page and notes and put a tag and filter them, but to make collections, and that they can be linked I would have to do it manually which gives me a little laziness and also seems time consuming.
